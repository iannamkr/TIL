## Functional programming as a paradigm
- Functional programming (FP) is a **paradigm** of programming.
- _The main principal of FP is to write code as a mathematical expression or fomula._
  - This approach allows programmers to derive code through logical reasoning rather than through guessing.
- Scala code for certain computational tasks corresponds quite closely tomathematical formulas.
- Large code expressions may be split into smaller expressions when needed. Expressions can be easily reused, flexibly composed.


## The mathematical meaning of “variables”
- Arguments of functions
- **Variables are immutable named constants**
  - Mathematics has the convention that a variable, such as x, does not change its value within a formula.
- Each argument of each function must have a type that represents the set of possible allowed values for that function argument.
> The programming language’s compiler will automatically check the types of all arguments before the program runs. A program that calls functions on arguments of incorrect types will not compile.


## Iteration without loops
- Handling of iteration without writing loops.
- The functional programming paradigm has developed rich tools for translating mathematical induction into code. (.map, .filter, .sum)
